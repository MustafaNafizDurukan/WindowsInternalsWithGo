# ****Windows Internals with Go****

Welcome to the Windows Internals with Go repository! This is the official code repository for our series on Windows Internals, where we delve into the intricacies of the Windows operating system using the GoLang programming language.

## **Why This Repository?**

This repository serves as a companion to the Windows Internals series hosted on **[mustafanafizdurukan.github.io](https://mustafanafizdurukan.github.io/)**. Here, you'll find all the GoLang code snippets and examples used in the articles. We believe that the best way to learn is through a blend of theory and practice, and this repository allows you to get your hands dirty with real code.

## **What's Inside?**

The code in this repository is organized by topic, corresponding to the structure of the Windows Internals series:

- Basic Concepts
- System Architecture
- Processes and Threads
- Object Management
- Memory Management
- Interrupts and Exceptions
- Services
- I/O System
- Device Drivers
- Writing Software Device Drivers

Each topic has its own folder containing relevant GoLang scripts.
